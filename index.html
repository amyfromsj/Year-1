    <p>
      <strong>HAPPY 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY HONEY! ♡</strong><br> <br> This whole year has been full of happiness and excitement, but also some
      loss and growth. Yet in every situation, you always
      make me feel so safe. The security you provide makes me confident that you'll be a great dad one day. Although it makes me careless sometimes, because I feel so safe and comfortable that I'll go out into the world doing something
      careless. But I've always been a really careful
      person, so it's cathartic for me to not stress and worry about my surroundings all the time.
      <br><br>
      To be honest, I've been thinking about our 1-year since the beginning. In my head it was a fact that we'd get to this point, I never questioned whether it would happen, I only thought about when it would
      happen. <br><br> <strong>A SMOL RECAP • ◡ •</strong> <br><br> The first few months of dating were so exciting and
      wild. We
      were strangers whose paths crossed - all because we had the same idea, at the same time. Now, we are one year in
      and we still
      get the same ideas. However, it's different since we'll say the same thing at the same time,
      and then
      cringe afterwards about how gross we are. This is what I love about us - we laugh at everything (even
      existentially at the relationship). <br><br> We've also integrated our lives and our relationship has become more peaceful and homey. Rather than anticipating a new adventurous date or text from you like when we first started dating, I get to look forward to coming home to you after work, playing TFT,
      and pp-ing you to sleep. <br><br>  <small>(HOWEVER THE HONEYMOON PERIOD DOESN'T EXIST, OK? I WILL ALWAYS FEEL
        BUTTERFLIES)</small> <br><br> In
      the beginning I told you to savor our time together (when we were both unemployed and spent 24/7 together). I
      said it was a luxury to have so much time for each other, because I knew one day we'd start working towards our
      future and supporting <s>our expensive hobbies</s> ourselves. Now that time has come, and we're making that future a
      reality (yay!). We definitely have less
      time together, but it makes me so happy to know we're taking care of our future. <br><br> I love you so much and I
      just want to let you know you make me so happy. You are my most favorite human ever, and also the most annoying person at the
      same time. I look forward to each day we have ahead of us and I can't wait for us to move in hehe. <br><br> 

      
      
      This letter is only a
      drop of
      water from the ocean of my feelings for you. I love you more than I can express in words. <br> <br>Happy 1 year
      honey! <br> <br> To
      many more,
      <BR><BR>
        <br> <br>
      <strong>♡ Your PP</strong>   </p>
